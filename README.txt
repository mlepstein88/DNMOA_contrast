Reference:
"A dynamic normalization model of temporal attention"

Instructions:
The model code is a library of MATLAB functions. Put the directory on your computer and run the code from this directory in MATLAB.

If you are new to this code, start with demo.m. This function demonstrates how to run the model. Each cell shows how to select certain options and run the model using those options.

The function setParameters.m lists all model parameters and can be used to set the default parameters. Preloaded default settings are based on the “Main” model fit reported in the manuscript.

For reference, the purpose of each function is briefly described in listOfFunctions.m.
